The overall objective of this project was to develop a C application to simulate a generic request and response system, involving three different types of participants: clients, proxies, and servers. This application, named SOVACCINES, simulated the process of vaccine acquisition and distribution. In this context, clients represented healthcare and pharmaceutical facilities (e.g., Alvalade Health Center), proxies were distribution services (e.g., Alliance Healthcare, S.A.), and servers were pharmaceutical laboratories that produced and supplied vaccines (e.g., Johnson & Johnson, Ltd)
